# freeCodeCamp Daily Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the **Daily Coding Challenges** from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  
Each day, freeCodeCamp releases a new programming puzzle that can be solved in JavaScript or Python.  
Here, I document my daily solutions in JavaScript.
